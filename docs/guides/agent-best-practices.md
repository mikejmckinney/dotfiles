# Agent Best Practices

> **Purpose**: Guidance for working effectively with AI coding agents, including known limitations and mitigations.

## Token Limits and Context Management

### The Problem

AI models have limited context windows (measured in tokens). Large codebases or verbose documentation can exceed these limits, causing:
- Truncated context (agent misses important information)
- Degraded performance (too much irrelevant context)
- Higher costs (more tokens = more cost)
- "Lost in the Middle" problem where content in the middle of long documents is poorly attended to

### The 200-Line Rule

**If a single instruction file exceeds ~200 lines, split it into sub-modules.**

This prevents the "Lost in the Middle" attention issue where LLMs struggle to attend to content in the middle of long documents. Long files should be broken into focused sub-files that can be loaded on-demand.

Example:
```
# Instead of one 500-line rules file:
.context/rules/all_rules.md (500 lines) ❌

# Split into focused modules:
.context/rules/domain_auth.md (100 lines) ✓
.context/rules/domain_api.md (120 lines) ✓
.context/rules/domain_ui.md (80 lines) ✓
.context/rules/coding_standards.md (90 lines) ✓
```

### Mitigations

#### 1. Keep Individual Files Small

| File Type | Target Size | Maximum |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Context files (`.context/`) | < 200 lines | 500 lines |
| Documentation | < 300 lines | 1000 lines |
| Code files | < 400 lines | 800 lines |

If a file exceeds these limits, split it:
```
# Instead of one large file:
.context/rules.md (800 lines)

# Split into focused files:
.context/rules/domain_auth.md (150 lines)
.context/rules/domain_data.md (200 lines)
.context/rules/domain_api.md (180 lines)
```

#### 2. Use Clear File Names

Agents can selectively load files based on names. Use descriptive names:

```
# Good - agent knows what to load
.context/rules/domain_authentication.md
.context/state/active_task_user_registration.md

# Bad - agent must read to understand
.context/rules/misc.md
.context/state/current.md
```

#### 3. Provide a Context Summary

For large projects, create a summary file that agents can read first:

```markdown
# .context/SUMMARY.md

## Quick Reference
- Auth: See rules/domain_auth.md
- API: See rules/domain_api.md
- Current task: Implementing user registration
- Blocked by: Waiting for design review

## What to Read
1. This file (you're here)
2. state/_active.md or task_*.md (current work)
3. Only load rules/* files when making changes to those domains
```

#### 4. Use the Priority Hierarchy

Don't duplicate information across files. Reference instead:

```markdown
# Good - reference, don't duplicate
See .context/rules/domain_auth.md for authentication requirements.

# Bad - duplicated content that may get out of sync
Authentication must use bcrypt with cost factor 12...
(same content copied to multiple files)
```

## State File Conflict Prevention

### The Problem

If multiple agents work simultaneously (or a human and agent), task files can have merge conflicts.

### Mitigations

#### 1. One Active Task at a Time

The simplest solution: only one task should be in progress at once. Complete the current task before starting a new one.

#### 2. Multiple Task Files (for parallel work)

If you need parallel task tracking, use separate files:

```
.context/state/
├── _active.md               # Points to priority task
├── task_feature_auth.md     # Task 1 details
├── task_bugfix_api.md       # Task 2 details
└── task_refactor_ui.md      # Task 3 details
```

#### 3. Lock Before Working

Add a simple lock mechanism:

```markdown
# _active.md

## Lock Status
**Locked By**: agent-cursor-session-abc123
**Locked At**: 2025-01-25T14:30:00Z
**Expected Duration**: 30 minutes

## Current Task
...
```

Agents should check the lock before modifying.

#### 4. Use Git Branches

For significant parallel work, use feature branches. Each branch has its own state:

```bash
# Branch: feature/user-auth
.context/state/task_auth.md  # Auth work

# Branch: feature/api-refactor  
.context/state/task_api.md   # API work
```

Merge conflicts only occur when branches merge.

## Workflow Secrets Configuration

### Required Secrets

The CI workflows in this template require these GitHub repository secrets:

| Secret | Required By | How to Get It |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `BACKEND_URL` | `keep-warm.yml`, `validate-connections.yml` | Your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://myapp.onrender.com`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Optional for `validate-connections.yml` | Connection string from your database provider |

### How to Set Secrets

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add each secret:
   - Name: `BACKEND_URL`
   - Value: `https://your-backend-url.com`
5. Click **Add secret**

### Optional Secrets for Deployment

If you add deployment workflows, you may need:

| Secret | Purpose | Where to Get |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | Vercel deployments | [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) |
| `VERCEL_ORG_ID` | Vercel org identifier | Vercel project settings |
| `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` | Vercel project identifier | Vercel project settings |
| `RAILWAY_TOKEN` | Railway deployments | [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/account/tokens) |
| `RENDER_API_KEY` | Render deployments | [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings) |

### Secrets Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** to the repository
2. **Use environment-specific secrets** (different values for staging vs. production)
3. **Rotate secrets regularly** (especially after team member departures)
4. **Use secret scanning** (pre-commit hooks or GitHub's built-in scanning)
5. **Limit access** (only give secrets to workflows that need them)

## Session Handoff Protocol

When an agent session ends (or a new agent takes over), follow this protocol:

### Ending a Session

1. **Update your task file** (`task_*.md`) with:
   - What was accomplished
   - What's left to do
   - Any blockers or open questions
   - Files that were modified

2. **Update `sessions/latest_summary.md`** with:
   - Key decisions made and their rationale
   - What didn't work (to prevent repeating mistakes)
   - Next session recommendations

3. **Commit work in progress**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: [task description] - session handoff"
   ```

4. **Leave clear next steps**:
   ```markdown
   ## Next Session Should
   1. Run tests to verify current state: `npm test`
   2. Continue with step 3 of implementation plan
   3. Address the TODO in src/auth.ts:42
   ```

### Starting a Session (The Onboarding Protocol)

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Read the current task**:
   ```
   .context/state/_active.md  # or task_*.md
   ```
   This tells you the immediate goal.

2. **Read the context index**:
   ```
   .context/00_INDEX.md
   ```
   This tells you where to find relevant rules/constraints.

3. **Check session history** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   .context/sessions/latest_summary.md
   ```
   This tells you what was tried, what worked, what didn't.

4. **Verify environment stability**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ./scripts/verify-env.sh  # or npm run verify
   ```

5. **Check recent decisions** (if available):
   - Skim the last closed PR
   - Review `sessions/latest_summary.md`

6. **Report readiness** (The Report Step):
   
   Before proceeding, output a status report:
   ```
   "I have reviewed the context.
   - Current task: [Task Name from task file]
   - Environment: [Stable/Unstable based on verify-env output]
   - Last session: [Brief summary from sessions/latest_summary.md]
   - Ready for instructions."
   ```
   
   This confirms context was loaded correctly and prevents silent failures.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Assuming Instead of Verifying

**Wrong**: "The API probably uses REST"
**Right**: Check `AI_REPO_GUIDE.md` or search for API patterns in the codebase

### 2. Making Sweeping Changes

**Wrong**: "Let me refactor the entire auth system while fixing this bug"
**Right**: Make minimal, focused changes. Create separate tasks for refactoring.

### 3. Ignoring CI Failures

**Wrong**: Mark task complete even though CI is red
**Right**: Read CI logs, fix issues, verify green before completing

### 4. Not Updating Documentation

**Wrong**: Change behavior without updating docs
**Right**: Update `AI_REPO_GUIDE.md` if commands, structure, or conventions change

### 5. Duplicating Context

**Wrong**: Copy the same information to multiple files
**Right**: Put it in one authoritative place and reference it elsewhere
